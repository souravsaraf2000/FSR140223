            Light is an extremely brilliant but bored high-school student. Until the strange day where he accidentally encounters the Death Note; a mysterious notebook with the power to kill anyone whose name is written inside it.
            With the Death Note in hand, he goes on a personal crusade and moves to kill all evil in the world and become God. He does this all in his new name, Kira, and declares himself the law and justice of the world.
            At first things go as he planned, and he moves toward making a 'better' world. However, things don't go as he had anticipated as the relentless 'L' works to track him down, and arrest him.
