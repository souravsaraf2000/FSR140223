Access Modifiers:

1. Public - Data Member is accessible everywhere
2. Private - Data Member is only available inside the class
3. Protected - Data Member is available inside the class and its children only, not everywhere!!


When you inherit a class, you inherit all of its PUBLIC Data Member and ALL Member functions. Private members are NEVER inherited!
