5 HTTP Methods:

1. GET - To get some data from backend

2. POST - To create a new entry in the database

3. PATCH - Updation - Only certain fields

4. PUT - Updation - All values

5. DELETE - Delete


If we are directly dealing with database, there are majorly 2 disadvantages:

1. I/O in database is slow
2. DB maynot always have validation criteria -> Inconsistent Data will be stored in DB


To solve the above issues Node.js servers play a very important role.

Node.js Servers (Express.js + MongoDB + Node.js).

Server validates any information before inserting it in into the database.
Server is also responsible to perform CRUD operations on DB and provide suitable response on FrontEnd.
